# C7 Data Migrator

### How to use the Migrator

1. Prerequisites: Use Java 21
2. Consider whether any of the [migration limitations](#migration-limitations) apply to your current C7 models and apply any changes necessary.
1. Stop C7 process execution. I.e., shut down your engines.
2. Migrate your models 
   1. Can use https://migration-analyzer.consulting-sandbox.camunda.cloud/ to migrate your C7 models.
   2. If required, make any manual adjustments required in the C8 models. Note the migrator tool will leave hints in your diagram.
   3. Add "migrator" End Execution listener of the start event of each C8 model. Example: [link](./qa/src/test/resources/io/camunda/migrator/bpmn/c8/simpleProcess.bpmn).
1. Start C8.
1. Deploy migrated C8 process models.
1. Build or download the distribution.
1. Start Migrator (start.sh/start.bat) and wait to finish.
1. Navigate to Operate and check result.

#### Migration Limitations
- Message events:
  - only message catch and throw events are supported for migration
  - depending on your implementation, you may need to add [a correlation variable](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/message-events/#messages) to the instance pre migration
- Boundary events:
  - currently not supported

## Development Setup

   1. Extract files
   1. Start from distribution root by running `./start.sh` (or `c8run.exe start`)
1. Clone this repository
1. Build from root with `mvn clean install` (add `-DskipTests` to skip the tests)
1. (Optional) Run the [example data generator](./examples/generate-runtime/src/main/java/io/camunda/migrator/example/ExampleApplication.java)
1. (Optional) Run the migrator
   1. Either using [the example](./examples/migrate-runtime/src/main/java/io/camunda/migrator/example/RuntimeExampleApplication.java)
