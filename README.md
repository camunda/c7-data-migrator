# C7 Data Migrator

### How to use the Migrator

1. Prerequisites: Use Java 21
2. Consider whether any of the [migration limitations](#migration-limitations) apply to your current C7 models and apply any changes necessary.
1. Stop C7 process execution. I.e., shut down your engines.
2. Migrate your models 
   1. Can use https://migration-analyzer.consulting-sandbox.camunda.cloud/ to migrate your C7 models.
   2. If required, make any manual adjustments required in the C8 models. Note the migrator tool will leave hints in your diagram.
   3. Add "migrator" End Execution listener of the start event of each C8 model. Example: [link](./qa/src/test/resources/io/camunda/migrator/bpmn/c8/simpleProcess.bpmn).
1. Start C8.
1. Deploy migrated C8 process models.
1. Build or download the distribution.
1. Start Migrator (start.sh/start.bat) and wait to finish.
1. Navigate to Operate and check result.

#### Migration Limitations
- Message events:
  - only message catch and throw events are supported for migration
  - depending on your implementation, you may need to add [a correlation variable](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/message-events/#messages) to the instance pre migration
- Triggered Boundary events:
  - C7 boundary events do not have a natural wait state
  - If the process instance to be migrated is currently at a triggered boundary event in Camunda 7, there may still be a job associated with that event, either waiting to be executed or currently running. In this state, the token is considered to be at the element where the job is created: typically the first activity of the boundary event’s handler flow, or technically the point after the boundary event if asyncAfter is used.
  - During migration to Camunda 8, the token will be mapped to the corresponding target element. However, if that element expects input data that is normally produced by the boundary event’s job (e.g. setting variables), this data may be missing in the migrated instance.
  - Recommendation: To ensure a consistent migration, allow boundary event executions to complete before initiating the migration.
- There are elements that are supported in C7 but not supported in C8. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/components/modeler/bpmn/bpmn-coverage/) for more details on element support in C8 and adjust your models accordingly before migration.
- Call Activity
   - To migrate a subprocess that is started from a call activity, the migrator must set the `legacyId` variable for the subprocess. This requires propagating the parent variables. This can be achieved by updating the C8 call activity in one of the following ways:  
     - Set `propagateAllParentVariables` to `true` (this is the default) in the `zeebe:calledElement` extension element.  
     - Or, if `propagateAllParentVariables` is set to `false`, provide an explicit input mapping:  
   ```xml
   <zeebe:ioMapping>
     <zeebe:input source="=legacyId" target="legacyId" />
   </zeebe:ioMapping>

#### Configuration

* migrator.batch-size - configure number of items (process instances, jobs) to be processed per iteration. Default: 500


## Development Setup
1. Prerequisites: Use Java 21
1. Set up Camunda 8
   1. Download Camunda [c8run-8.8](https://github.com/camunda/camunda/releases/tag/c8run-8.8)
   1. Extract files
   1. Start from distribution root by running `./start.sh` (or `c8run.exe start`)
1. Clone this repository
1. Build from root with `mvn clean install` (add `-DskipTests` to skip the tests)
1. (Optional) Run the [example data generator](./examples/generate-runtime/src/main/java/io/camunda/migrator/example/ExampleApplication.java)
1. (Optional) Run the migrator
   1. Either using [the example](./examples/migrate-runtime/src/main/java/io/camunda/migrator/example/RuntimeExampleApplication.java)
   1. Or by building, extracting and running [the distribution](./assembly)
